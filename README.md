# Description of the application:
This is application is for educational purpopes only. This app will take a person's age as an input to the age of different people in history when they passed away. In other terms it will make a comparision from the user's age to famous historical figures.

The project is useful in terms of education, because the learners (users) will learn about famous historical figures all the most having fun whilst doing it. Anybody can use it, and it keeps learners entertained and keeps them learning about different historical figures. In the end it makes learning easier especially for mentally challlenged kids.

Upon starting the program you will be met by a complex background with an image and a text that says "World Age" at the center top. Then under the image, you will then put in an age from 20-100. DO NOTE THAT ANY NUMBER/AGE BELOW OR ABOVE 20-100 WILLL BE REGARDED AS INVALID! A message under the inputed number will dispaly: "Invalid Please Put In A Number between 20-100"

# Installing under Windows
When installing MyHistoryAgeApp onto your device it is recommended that you install to a API 26.
However installing it on a API 27 or higher is also fine, the disadvantage is that it will require more time.
