# Purpose of my application:
This application is soley for students. 
A family friend (Sarah) needed my expertise to develop a special Android mobile application. She is an avid history buff and educator who wants to use technology to inspire young minds. She envisions an Android app that compares the user's age to famous figures from history. She believes that this app will not only be educational but also fun for students.
The project is useful in terms of education, because the learners (users) will learn about famous historical figures all the most having fun whilst doing it. Anybody can use it, and it keeps learners entertained and keeps them learning about different historical figures. In the end it makes learning easier especially for mentally challlenged kids, as this is application is for educational purpopes only. This app will take a person's age as an input to the age of different people in history when they passed away. In other terms it will make a comparision from the user's age to famous historical figures.


# UI Design (User-Interface Design) and Kotlin (Design consideration):
Upon starting the program you will be met by a complex background with an image and a text that says "World Age App" at the center top.Under the heading an image will be displayed.Then under the image, you will then put in an age from 20-100. DO NOTE THAT ANY NUMBER/AGE BELOW OR ABOVE 20-100 WILLL BE REGARDED AS INVALID! A message under the inputed number will display: "Invalid Please Put In A Number between 20-100". There'll be a generate button and a clear button provided also. The user-interface is easy to use and simple to understand.

In the kotlin side, four variables have been declared which are the two buttons, one edit text and one text view.
The problem defined was that the user's inputted age has to match one of the historical figures. So I have done my  research and got the required information such as their age and what they are known for. After acquiring the information, I now had to figure out the solution, which called for problem solving, which helped underpin the solution.
The underpinned solution that i gathered was using an if loop an arrays. The definition of arrays is a list of data. To simply apply the arrays I used ageMap and under it I put in the list of historical firgues. This works a memory location for the computer so that when a user inputs a numer or age, it quickly scans through the list and finds the correct number or age and information and the display it by the text view. Then comes the if loop. The if loop checks the condition of the user's input and then compares it to check if the corr

# Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub actions.
GitHub Actions make it easy to automate all your software workflows. Github Actions let you build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. You can also assign code reviews, manage branches, and triage issues the way you want with actions.

# Important!
MyHistoryAgeApp does not support IOS servers.
The program may pause on the first try of opening the app for serveal minutes, even though MyHistoryAgeApp is working correctly.
if you think your computer is locked up, please be patient and wait for MyHistoryAgeApp to finish the operation


# Installing under Windows
When installing MyHistoryAgeApp onto your device it is recommended that you install to a API 26.
However installing it on a API 27 or higher is also fine, the disadvantage is that it will require more time.
